# 1. Two Sum

Date Completed: 21/4/24 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) 

### Intuition
Initially, my idea was to do a nested loop where the second loop looped from the position of the first loop to compare the two and find the sum. It was a more brute force attempt and the first iteration took around ~11.3ms. I then attempted to apply a Hash map, something I'm learning right now, to find a solution.

### Approach
For the hash map solution, I created a for loop which, for every iteration, would set a complement which is equal to the target - current index value which represents the hash map attempting to find the target's complement value by iteratively finding the target - current index value. The complement represents the first value of the sum to the target while the loop index represents the second value to the sum. This is then returned. throw was implemented to complete the return statement.

### Closing Notes
This was my first start into exploring Hashmaps. The hashmap solution was less time efficient and of equal level to space efficiency but I've got to start somewhere.
